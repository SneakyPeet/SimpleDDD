# A Practical Domain Driven Design Project Template ![](https://travis-ci.org/SneakyPeet/SimpleDDD.svg?branch=master)

This is a companion project to the Practical Domain Driven Design articles posted on [sneakycode.net](http://sneakycode.net).
It gets updated in parallel with the above mentioned articles.

Eventually this project will be a usable project template where the parts that are not needed can be easily pruned.
